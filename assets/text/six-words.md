A week ago,   
we thought we had a shot—  
like we really could have made it  
if we just figured out   
some trick. Forgiveness, maybe,  
or even how to eat meals  
together without looking at our phones.  
It is tempting to let ourselves  
off the hook. To say, “This is  
nobody’s fault,” and, “Everything  
brilliant fades.”  
But it didn’t have to be now;  
it didn’t have to be closing in  
as inevitable as the ground  
when you’re falling. Maybe  
nothing ends that doesn’t end suddenly.  
We should have had more fun.
